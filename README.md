# Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices using the Car Price Prediction dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of cars based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project, sourced from Kaggle ([Car Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction/data)), includes information on car specifications such as make, model, engine type, horsepower, mileage, and price. It consists of both numerical and categorical features, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: 
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and handle missing values.
   - Data preprocessing steps included feature engineering, normalization of numerical data, and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated for predicting car prices, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like random forests.
   - Model performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared were used to assess and compare model accuracy.

3. **Results and Insights**:
   - The best-performing model achieved a high accuracy score, indicating its effectiveness in predicting car prices based on the selected features.
   - Insights gained from the analysis include the most influential features affecting car prices and potential areas for further improvement in model performance.
